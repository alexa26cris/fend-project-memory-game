Memory Game

A project created for Udacity and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How To Play:

This is a memory matching card game. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that have the same icon.
The game has 16 cards and 8 pairs in total. Click on a card, remember it and its place in the grid, then click on other cards until you find its match. You win and complete the game when all 8 pairs are successfully matched.

Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the number of your moves, the star rating, and how long it takes to finish the game. When you win, you'll see your total moves, your star rating and how much time it took to win the game.
